    "\n",
    "### Key Libraries to be Installed:\n",
    "- **scikit-learn (sklearn)**: A comprehensive library for machine learning in Python, providing tools for classification, regression, clustering, dimensionality reduction, model selection, and preprocessing.\n",
    "- **imbalanced-learn (imblearn)**: A package offering techniques to deal with imbalanced datasets, which are common in classification tasks. It provides methods for over-sampling, under-sampling, and combination sampling."
