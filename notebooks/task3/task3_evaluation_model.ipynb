    "### Evaluation\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Regression Performance**: EfficientNetB0 provides a full set of regression metrics:\n",
    "  - **RMSE = 3.6670**, indicating low prediction error.\n",
    "  - **R² = 0.8352**, showing strong correlation and explaining ~83.5% of the variance in the age data.\n",
    "\n",
    "- While InceptionV3 achieves a lower **MAE**, EfficientNetB0 still performs well with acceptable error margins for practical deployment.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Training Stability**: EfficientNetB0 converged steadily and avoided overfitting, completing 97 epochs with consistent improvement, demonstrating strong generalization potential.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Deployment Readiness**: EfficientNetB0 is lighter and more efficient compared to InceptionV3, making it highly suitable for **mobile or edge deployment** — a key consideration for real-world agricultural applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Ultimate Judgement\n",
    "\n",
    "**EfficientNetB0 is chosen as the final model** for rice age prediction.\n",
    "\n",
    "It offers:\n",
    "- Reliable regression performance (RMSE & R²),\n",
    "- Simplicity and speed,\n",
    "- Scalability for future datasets,\n",
    "- And ease of deployment on resource-constrained devices.\n",
    "\n",
    "> While InceptionV3 slightly edges out in MAE, **EfficientNetB0 provides a better balance of performance, efficiency, and practical usability**, making it the optimal model for production.\n"
